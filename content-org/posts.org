**** Foreword

	 This is post is about how to deploy a Godot game to GitHub

	 GIF of my demo game

	 link to my demo page/game

***** LD 45 is happening soon

***** Web version is easy for people to play

	  no download

	  no OS restriction, as long as browser is good

***** VC good

	  source control is good

	  have a github account means you have a CDN

**** Actual content

***** summary of what we are doing

	  deploy a game made with Godot engine to github using the github page setup

***** Requirements

	  have a github account

	  have a game on godot engine

***** Setup

	  game is ready to go

	  local repo

	  remote branch on github

***** Step 1: export the game

	  export to HTML5, destination PROJECT_ROOT/docs

	  #+attr_html: :alt Export UI, missing export template
	  #+attr_html: :width 800
	  [[file:export_ui.png]]

	  comment abou altering index.html

	  might need to download export template, it is available on Godot's download page

	  use Firefox to test locally

	  use a local server if you have problem loading the game

	  Chrome might need to have its webassembly flag turned on

***** Step 2: git and github things

	  push to github

	  setup github page to serve from master branch and docs folder

	  Repo->settings->github page->serving files from
	  

***** PROFIT!

	  go to the page URL, you should see the game

	  another benefit, when you make changes to the game, merge it to master then push will auto matically update the game, good for other people to test

***** additional stuff

	  not just limit to godot, any engine that let's you export to web format should work

	  bitbucket also has a "page" setup i believe is similar to github page

	  using sub module

	  automation and diff branch
